- Virtual Office --- A part of the app where a user can request consultation and the lawyer or law firm can in turn deliver legal service.
1, The user clicks on Request Consultation button on the profile of a Lawyer or Firm which displays a message box where they give a brief statement of their legal need.
2, The lawyer or firm can choose to accept or deny the consultation request.
------On request acceptance, the user becomes a client to the lawyer or firm.
------On request denial. the lawyer or firm gives a good reason for declining the request. (A warning message will be displayed to lawyers and firms on the downside to indiscriminately declining requests without good reason). The user will be notified about the request decline to enable them reach out to another lawyer.
